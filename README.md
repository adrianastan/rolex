# RoLEX
## An extended Romanian lexical dataset


The dataset was developed mainly for speech processing applications, yet its applicability extends beyond this domain. *RoLEX* includes over 330,000 curated entries with information regarding: lemma, morphosyntactic description, syllabification, lexical stress and phonemic transcription.  
The process of selecting the list of word entries and semi-automatically annotating the complete lexical information associated with each of the entries is thoroughly described.

Additional resources, such as lexical information prediction models will soon be added.
